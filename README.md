## Usage


You can find complete working example here https://github.com/awaik/flutter_instagram_stories/tree/master/example

*Dart code*

Connect to collection where you keep stories

```dart
  static String collectionDbName = 'instagram_stories_db';
  CollectionReference dbInstance =
      Firestore.instance.collection(collectionDbName);
```

And add stories full functionality to your app.

```dart
      body: SafeArea(
        child: FlutterInstagramStories(
          collectionDbName: collectionDbName,
          showTitleOnIcon: true,
          fontSizeIcon: 16.0,
          //TODO: showTitleInStory: true,
          //TODO: fontSizeStory: 18.0,
          iconWidth: 150.0,
          iconHeight: 150.0,
          //how long story lasts in seconds
          imageStoryDuration: 7,
          progressPosition: ProgressPosition.top,
          repeat: true,
          inline: false,
        ),
      ),
```

*Firestore database*

Plugin works with Firestore database and package https://pub.dev/packages/cloud_firestore already included into plugin.

You can use example with open database or create your own database.

Steps to create:

1. Add Firebase to your app

- Android https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup?platform=android
- iOS https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup?platform=ios

2. Create Firestore database

- Create collection with any name. After you will use this name in dart code only once.
- Create documents inside collection with exact structure, like on image below


```
    DateTime date;
    List file[
        String filetype;
        String url;
        ]
    String title;
    String previewImage;
```
